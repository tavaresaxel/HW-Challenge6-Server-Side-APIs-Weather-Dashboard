## Description

This is a website created to help inform people of the weather of the locations they are interested in. Not only does it show the weather for the location the day off but also shows what the weather would look like in the next five days. This website can help people looking to travel or prepare an event to know what the day outside is going to be looking like. This can avoid having to deal with bad weather on those situations.
